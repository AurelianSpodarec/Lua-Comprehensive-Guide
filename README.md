# Tables aka Objects & Arrays

Lua doesn't have objects nor arrays - it has just tables. s
Tables in luas is Arr
Objects in Lua are called Tables. 
Objects in Lua are called Arrays.They serve as an array and object.

To insert into the database, you need to `table.insert(table, value)`

To unpack values from a table, you need to unpack(data)

If you print a table, you will see table hash therefore you need to use special pairs and ipairs to show the content


<!-- object.getHash() -->
<!-- object.print() -->
<!-- object.count() -->
<!-- object.insertTo(object, data) -->
<!-- object.removeFrom(data, index) -->
<!-- object.unpack(data) -->
<!-- object.returnHashes() -->
<!-- object.create -->

<!-- Lua utility -->

To access properties of tables, you need to use special functions. pairs and ipairs.

Here are a few ways to work with them.

JavaScript Example
```js


```

Lua Example
```

```


LUA Example
```
local people = {
    test = {
    ['99'] = {
         name = "Fred",
         address = "16 Long Street",
         phone = "123456"
     },
     ['8989'] = {
         name = "Wilma",
         address = "16 Long Street",
         phone = "123456"
        }
    }
}
```
  
--   for index, data in pairs(people.test) do
--       print(index)
  
--       -- for key, value in pairs(data) do
--       --     print('\t', key, value)
--       -- end
--   end
  
  -- hash breaks this

# Working with JSON



# Have plugins
Copy and paste it in your file app/illuminate

- JSON - ability to decode JSON into Lua
- Table [ print table Content], not just hash
